        <h3>Combine open..</h3>

	  <font color="black">
		<p>The modern Combine harvester, or simply combine, is a versatile machine designed to efficiently harvest a variety of grain crops. The name derives from its combining three separate harvesting operations reaping, threshing, and winnowing into a single process.
		Among the crops harvested with a combine<br>
are wheat, oats, rye, barley, corn (maize), sorghum, soybeans, flax (linseed), sunflowers and Carolan. <br>The separated straw, left lying on the field, comprises the stems and any remaining leaves of the crop with limited nutrients left in it: the straw is then either chopped, 
spread on the field and unploughed back in or baled for bedding and limited-feed for livestock.<br>
Combine harvesters are one of the most economically important laborsaving inventions, 
significantly reducing the fraction of the population engaged in agriculture. </p>

<p>Combines, some of them quite large, were drawn by mule or horse teams and used a bull wheel to provide power. Later, steam power was used, and George Stockton Berry integrated the combine with a steam engine using straw to heat the boiler. At the turn of the twentieth century, 
horse drawn combines were starting to be used on the American plains and Idaho (often pulled by teams of twenty or more horses).</p><br>

<p>Tractor-drawn combines (also called pull-type combines) became common after World War II as many farms began to use tractors. An example was the All-Crop Harvester series. These combines used a shaker to separate the grain from the chaff and straw-walkers (grates with small teeth on an eccentric shaft) to eject the straw while retaining the grain. Early tractor-drawn combines were usually powered by a separate gasoline engine, while later models were PTO-powered. These machines either put the harvested crop into bags that were then loaded onto a wagon or truck, 
or had a small bin that stored the grain until it was transferred to a truck or wagon with an auger.</p><br>

<p>A significant advance in the design of combines was the rotary design. The grain is initially stripped from the stalk by passing along a helical rotor, instead of passing between rasp bars on the outside of a cylinder and a concave. 
Rotary combines were first introduced by Sperry-New Holland in 1975. </p><br>

<p>In about the 1980s on-board electronics were introduced to measure threshing efficiency. 
This new instrumentation allowed operators to get better grain yields by optimizing ground speed and other operating parameters.</p><br>
