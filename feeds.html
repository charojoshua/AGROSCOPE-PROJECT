        <h3>Animal Feeds.</h3>
      </div>
	   <font color="black"><p> <b>Feed</b>, also called animal feed, food grown or developed for livestock and poultry. Modern feeds are produced by carefully selecting and blending ingredients to provide highly nutritional diets that both maintain the health of the animals and increase the quality of such end products as meat, milk, or eggs. Ongoing improvements in animal diets have resulted from research, experimentation, and chemical analysis by agricultural scientists.</p>
	    <p><b>Animals need different kinds of foods and supplements to remain healthy and the below are some of them:</b></p>
<ol>
<p><b><li type="disc">Proteins</li></b><br>
For immature animals, protein is also needed for growth of the muscles and other parts of the body. Since milk, eggs, and wool contain much protein, additional amounts are needed in the feed of animals producing these. All animals require a small amount of protein for maintenanceâ€”i.e., the daily repair of muscles, internal organs, and other body tissues.</p>

<p><b><li type="disc">Carbohydrates and fats</li></b><br>
Most animals get energy from carbohydrates and fats, which are oxidized in the body. These yield heat, which maintains body temperature, furnishes energy for growth and muscle activity, and sustains vital functions. Animals need much more energy (and more total feed) for growth, work, or milk production than for simple maintenance.</p>

<p><b><li type="disc">Minerals</li></b><br>
Minerals essential for animal life include common salt (sodium chloride), calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, cobalt, iodine, zinc, molybdenum, and selenium. The last six of these can be toxic to animals if excessive amounts are eaten.
All farm animals generally need more common salt than is contained in their feeds, and they are supplied with it regularly. Of the other essential minerals, phosphorus and calcium are most apt to be lacking, because they are heavily drawn upon to produce bones, milk, and eggshells. Good sources of calcium and phosphorus are bone meal, dicalcium phosphate, and defluorinated phosphates.
 Eggshells are nearly pure calcium carbonate. Calcium may readily be supplied by ground limestone, ground seashells, or marl, which are all high in calcium.</p>



<p><b><li type="disc">Vitamins</li></b><br>
Known vitamins include the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K, and the water-soluble B group of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, choline, biotin, folic acid, and vitamins B and B and vitamin C.
Vitamin A, the one most part  to be lacking in livestock feeds, is required for growth, reproduction, milk production, and the maintenance of normal resistance to respiratory infections.
 All green-growing crops are rich in carotene, which animals can convert into vitamin A. Vitamin A supplement is added to animal diets to ensure a supply when livestock are not fed green forages and are not on good pasture.</p>
